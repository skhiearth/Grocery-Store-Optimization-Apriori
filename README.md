# Grocery-Store-Optimization-Apriori-Eclat
Implementing Association Rule Learning (Apriori and Eclat) in R to optimize placements of similars products in a supermarket.

The dataset is from a ficticious supermarket that wants to increase its sales by optimizing placements of products in the physical space based on relationships between the products. We use the Apriori algorithm to help solve the business problem. We also use Eclat to visualise sets of products frequently brought together.
